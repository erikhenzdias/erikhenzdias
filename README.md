- 👋 Hi, I’m @erikhenzdias
- 👀 I’m interested in football, tech and stuff alike.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, R and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing specific for now.
- 📫 Since I'm a beginner, I don't think I'll be of much use in this first moment, even though I'm more than avaliable to participate in projects in which learning is a key detail.
